STRUTS
======

For most containers, you need only to:

* Copy the WAR files in your Struts < /webapp > directory to your containers
  < webapps > directory.

* In some cases, you may need to restart your container if it is running.

For more details, and container-specific instructions, see the Installation 
chapter of the Struts User Guide.
